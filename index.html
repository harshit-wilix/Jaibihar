                <p>The Civil Services Exam (CSE) in India is a nationwide competitive examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).

Via the Civil Services Examination, the UPSC recruits candidates for various Central and All India Civil Service posts in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS), etc.

Latest update on Civil Services Exam:

Civil Services Exam 2021 revised dates are out.
Civil Services Interview 2020 to begin from August 2, 2021.
UPSC Civil Services Exam 2021 Details:Most of us opt for Civil Services for a red beacon or just to become famous, but as long as there is no commitment towards helping people and addressing their solutions – the real point of becoming an IAS is suppressed. Civil Services, unlike the private jobs and businesses, shouldn’t be approached with ‘what is there for me?’ Rather it should have an outlook of societal reformation, and candidates must see the macro picture of what they can deliver for the nation and how they can bring positive changes in the current manifesto of society.</p>

                <h3> <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Student Problems </h3>
                <p>Stress And Anxiety:
Rigorous college curriculum brings along with it a huge amount of stress. But academics is not the only contributing factor; constant worry over career choices and the struggle to fit in can pile up on them. Many people are also unhappy and unsatisfied with the colleges they end up in. This can turn the brightest of students into dull, underperforming ones. It also affects them physically, making them lose their appetite and disturbing their sleep cycle. Add depression and suicidal thoughts to this mess and you have a deadly cocktail of sorrow.Problems May Include, But are Not Limited to:
Disorganization/feeling overwhelmed.
Eating right and staying healthy.
Failing to manage money.
Failing to network.
Homesickness.
Not resolving relationship issues.
Poor grades/not studying or reading enough.
Poor sleep habits.</p>

            <h3>FREE MATERIAL </h3>
            <p>OER has been shown to increase student learning while breaking down barriers of affordability and accessibility. Feldstein et al. (2012) conducted a research study at Virginia State University, where OER were implemented across nine different courses in the business department. Researchers found that students in courses that used OER more frequently had better grades and lower failure and withdrawal rates than their counterparts in courses that did not use OER.</p>

            <h3>HERE TO HELP</h3>
            <p>We’ve all been there, whether it’s in a customer support setting or an argument with a friend or family member: it doesn’t feel good to talk to someone when you don’t think the person “gets” why you’re mad, upset or disappointed.

That’s why it’s critical to not just have and develop empathy but to convey it to your customer.


While mastering empathy might feel overwhelming at first, it becomes easier and easier as you work on it. (Just like any skill.)<p>
